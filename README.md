# Arkham Horror LCG: Return to the Wendigo

### What?
[Return to the Wendigo](#) is a 'fan-brew' scenario pack designed by the [Arkham.cards](https://patreon.com/arkhamdotcards) team to be compatible with [Arkham Horror: The Card Game](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-the-card-game/) by [Fantasy Flight Games](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/). It is a 'rework/fork/relocalization/remake' of another popular 'fan-brew' scenario called Against the Wendigo, originally designed by Vinn Quest.

The Return to the Wendigo scenario pack contains one custom scenario which may be played in standalone mode or as part of a large campaign.

### Why?
The original version of Against the Wendigo was a very well designed scenario, that we thought suffered from a few small issues that could easily be polished up by a third-party to make it more appealing to a wider range of players. In celebration of The Ghosts of Onigawa's one-year anniverary we thought it would be appropriate to spotlight another fan-brew creator's work that we have enjoyed (and give it a fresh coat of paint in the process.)

Return of the Wendigo v1.0 was released on 9/28/2023.
